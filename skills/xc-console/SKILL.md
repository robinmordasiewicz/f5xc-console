# F5 Distributed Cloud Console Automation Skill

Expert in automating F5 Distributed Cloud web console operations through browser automation using the `mcp__claude-in-chrome` MCP tools.

## Overview

This skill uses the `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` MCP tools which integrate with the Claude in Chrome browser extension. These tools provide:

- ✅ Works with your existing browser session (preserves Azure SSO authentication)
- ✅ Provides real-time visual feedback (watch Claude navigate in real time)
- ✅ Uses natural language instructions (no low-level scripting required)
- ✅ Automatically handles existing login state and cookies
- ✅ **Automatic SSO authentication** - detects session expiry and navigates login flows

### MCP Tools Available
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp` | Get browser tab context |
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate` | Navigate to URLs |
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_page` | Read page elements and structure |
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer` | Click, type, screenshot, scroll |
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__find` | Find elements by description |
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__form_input` | Fill form fields |
| `mcp__claude-in-chrome__get_page_text` | Extract page text content |

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure you have:

### 1. Claude in Chrome Extension
Install from Chrome Web Store and verify connection:
```bash
# Visit Chrome Web Store and install "Claude in Chrome" extension
# Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access

# Then verify the connection works:
claude --chrome

# In the Claude Code prompt, run:
/chrome

# You should see the connection status and options to enable by default
```

### 2. F5 XC API Credentials (for validation)
Set these environment variables for CLI-based verification:
```bash
export F5XC_API_URL="https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us"
export F5XC_API_TOKEN='2SiwIzdXcUTV9Kk/wURCJO+NPV8='
```

### 3. Azure SSO Authentication
You should already be logged into the F5 XC tenant in your Chrome browser. The skill leverages your existing session, but can also handle SSO automatically if session expires.

## SSO Authentication Handling

This skill automatically handles Azure SSO authentication when session expires:

### Detection Triggers
The skill detects login requirements when:
- URL redirects to `login.volterra.us` or `login.microsoftonline.com`
- Page contains "Sign in", "Go to login", or "Session expired" messages
- Login form or SSO button is visible

### Auto-Flow Sequence
```
1. Navigate to F5 XC tenant URL
2. Check for login page indicators using mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_page
3. If login detected:
   a. Find SSO button using mcp__claude-in-chrome__find
   b. Click SSO button using mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer
   c. Wait for Microsoft redirect
   d. If browser has cached Azure session → auto-completes
   e. If manual login needed → inform user, wait for confirmation
4. Verify F5 XC console loaded (look for workspace cards)
5. Continue with original navigation task
```

### SSO Handling Example
```
/xc:console login https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us/ and navigate to Web App and API Protection

# Claude will:
# 1. Get browser context with tabs_context_mcp
# 2. Navigate to tenant URL
# 3. Detect if session expired (read_page for login indicators)
# 4. Click SSO button if needed
# 5. Wait for authentication to complete
# 6. Navigate to Web App and API Protection workspace
# 7. Take screenshot to confirm
```

See `./sso-authentication-flow.md` for detailed workflow steps.

## Quick Start

### Basic Navigation
```bash
# Launch Claude Code with Chrome integration
claude --chrome

# Then provide natural language instructions:
"Navigate to https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us and tell me what you see on the home page"

# Claude will:
# 1. Navigate to the URL
# 2. Wait for page to load
# 3. Take a screenshot
# 4. Describe what it sees
```

### Form Filling
```bash
claude --chrome

"Navigate to the HTTP Load Balancers page at https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us.
Then click the 'Add HTTP Load Balancer' button.
Fill in the form with:
- Name: my-test-lb
- Namespace: production
- Domains: test.example.com

But stop before submitting - I want to review first."
```

### Data Extraction
```bash
claude --chrome

"Navigate to the HTTP Load Balancers list page.
Extract all load balancer names, their namespaces, and domains.
Save the results as a JSON array."
```

## Core Capabilities

### Navigation
- Navigate to any URL within the F5 XC console
- Click menu items, buttons, and links using text or selectors
- Switch between tabs and manage tab groups
- Handle redirects automatically (including Azure SSO redirect)

### Form Interaction
- Fill text inputs, textareas
- Select dropdown options
- Check/uncheck checkboxes
- Add/remove items from lists
- Complete multi-step forms

### Content Reading
- Extract text content from pages
- Read DOM structure and elements
- Take screenshots for visual verification
- Read console logs (useful for debugging)

### Debugging
- Inspect network requests (see API calls)
- Read console errors and warnings
- Analyze page structure
- Verify element visibility and properties

### Session Management
- Automatically uses existing Chrome session
- Preserves authentication state (Azure SSO)
- Handles session expiry gracefully
- Provides error messages when re-authentication needed

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create HTTP Load Balancer

```bash
claude --chrome

"I want to create an HTTP load balancer in F5 XC.

Please:
1. Navigate to https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us
2. Find and click the 'HTTP Load Balancers' page
3. Click 'Add HTTP Load Balancer' button
4. Fill in:
   - Name: demo-lb
   - Namespace: production
   - Domains: demo.example.com
   - Protocol: HTTPS with Automatic Certificate
5. Look for an 'Origin Pool' field and let me know what options are available

Don't submit yet - just show me the form filled in."
```

### Workflow 2: Explore Console Structure

```bash
claude --chrome

"Help me inventory the F5 Distributed Cloud console.

Navigate to https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us and:
1. Look at the main left sidebar menu
2. For each top-level menu item, tell me:
   - The menu item name
   - Any submenus
   - What page appears when clicked

Take screenshots of key pages so I can see the structure.
Organize the results as a hierarchical list."
```

### Workflow 3: Verify with CLI Integration

```bash
# First, use the console to create something
claude --chrome

"Navigate to HTTP Load Balancers page and create a new LB named 'cli-test' in 'default' namespace.
Don't submit yet - just tell me the form is ready."

# Then verify with CLI
f5xcctl configuration list http_loadbalancer -n default

# You should see the newly created resource in the list
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Taking Screenshots for Reference
```bash
claude --chrome

"Navigate to the HTTP Load Balancers creation form and take a screenshot.
Save it so I can see the exact form layout and field names."
```

### Handling Authentication Issues
When Claude encounters a login page, CAPTCHA, or other security challenge:
- Claude will pause and describe what it sees
- You manually handle the authentication (log in, solve CAPTCHA)
- Tell Claude to continue with the task
```bash
claude --chrome

"Try to navigate to https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us"

# If you get: "I see a login page. Azure SSO button is visible."
# You manually click the SSO button or provide credentials in your browser
# Then tell Claude: "I've logged in, continue with the task"
```

### Extracting Structured Data
```bash
claude --chrome

"Navigate to the HTTP Load Balancers list page.
For each load balancer shown, extract:
- Name
- Namespace
- Status
- Created date (if visible)

Format as a JSON array and save to lb-list.json"
```

## Documentation Integration

This skill is designed to work alongside official F5 XC documentation:
- See `documentation-index.md` for links to docs.cloud.f5.com
- Consult `console-navigation-metadata.json` for detailed form field information
- Review `workflows/` directory for step-by-step task guides

## Integration with Other F5 XC Skills

This skill works seamlessly with:

### f5xc-cli Skill (Query & Verify)
Use f5xcctl to validate console actions:
```bash
# After creating something in the console:
f5xcctl configuration get http_loadbalancer demo-lb -n production

# Compare what the console shows vs what the API returns
```

### f5xc-terraform Skill (Infrastructure as Code)
Use Terraform to deploy the same resources as code:
```bash
# The console skill helps you:
# 1. Understand the UI workflow
# 2. See all available options
# 3. Learn the resource structure
# Then use f5xc-terraform to automate it
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Break Large Tasks into Smaller Steps
```bash
# Instead of asking Claude to do everything in one go:
# ❌ "Create a complete load balancer with origin pool, health checks, and WAF policy"

# ✅ Do this in phases:
claude --chrome
# Phase 1: "Create origin pool named backend-pool"

# Phase 2: "Create HTTP LB named my-app pointing to backend-pool"

# Phase 3: "Add WAF policy to my-app LB"
```

### 2. Take Screenshots for Reference
```bash
claude --chrome

"Take screenshots of these pages and save them:
1. HTTP Load Balancers list page
2. HTTP Load Balancer creation form
3. Origin Pool creation form

I want to see the exact layout and field names."
```

### 3. Verify Console State with CLI
```bash
# After using console:
f5xcctl configuration list http_loadbalancer --all-namespaces --output-format json

# Compare with what console showed to ensure consistency
```

### 4. Be Specific with Instructions
```bash
# ❌ Too vague:
# "Create a load balancer"

# ✅ Specific:
# "Create HTTP load balancer named demo-lb in namespace 'production'
#  with domain example.com pointing to origin pool backend-pool.
#  Use HTTPS with automatic certificate."
```

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome Extension Not Connected
```bash
# 1. Verify extension is installed:
echo "Check Chrome Web Store for 'Claude in Chrome'"

# 2. Verify connection:
claude --chrome
/chrome

# 3. If not connected, reload the extension:
# - Go to chrome://extensions
# - Find "Claude in Chrome"
# - Click the reload icon
```

### Session Expired
When Claude says session expired:
```bash
# The console will automatically try to redirect to Azure SSO
# If you're already logged in: automatic redirect works
# If not: you may need to manually log in to Azure
# Then tell Claude to continue
```

### Form Fields Not Found
```bash
# Claude will describe what it sees
# Ask Claude to:
# 1. Take a screenshot
# 2. Describe all visible input fields
# 3. Look for the field by label text or placeholder

"Take a screenshot of the form.
Then find and fill the field labeled 'Domain' with 'example.com'."
```

### Navigation Paths Changed
The console UI may change. If Claude can't find expected buttons:
```bash
# Claude will explore and find the new location
"The button location seems to have changed.
Explore the page and find the 'Create' or 'Add' button, then click it."
```

## Security & Permissions

This skill operates within your existing Chrome browser session, so:
- ✅ Uses your existing Azure SSO login (no re-authentication needed)
- ✅ Respects your browser's cookie storage and session state
- ✅ Cannot access other browser tabs or extensions
- ⚠️ Can only interact with pages you have permission to access
- ⚠️ Should only be used with trusted instructions (avoid pasting untrusted prompts)

For sensitive operations:
- Review Claude's actions before it submits forms
- Use the preview/review step before final submission
- Verify critical operations with f5xcctl CLI afterward

## Getting Help

### Debugging Claude's Navigation
```bash
claude --chrome

"I notice you took a wrong turn. Let me help.
Take a screenshot and describe what page you're on.
Then tell me what button or link you see that matches 'HTTP Load Balancers'."
```

### Understanding Form Structure
```bash
claude --chrome

"Navigate to the form page and analyze its structure.
For each form field, tell me:
- The label text
- The input type (text, select, checkbox, etc.)
- Whether it's required
- Any visible validation hints"
```

### Learning Console Workflows
```bash
claude --chrome

"Walk me through the steps to create an HTTP load balancer from scratch.
Assume I have:
- A namespace named 'production'
- An origin pool named 'backend-pool'

Show me each page I'd need to visit and what I'd fill in."
```

## Deterministic Navigation

This skill uses pre-crawled metadata for deterministic browser automation. Instead of guessing or searching for elements, Claude uses pre-mapped element refs from `console-navigation-metadata.json`.

### How It Works

**Before (Exploratory - Less Reliable)**:
```
Claude: "Let me find the Add button..."
Uses: mcp__claude-in-chrome__find("Add HTTP Load Balancer")
Risk: Button text might change, might find wrong element
```

**After (Deterministic - Highly Reliable)**:
```
Claude: Loads metadata, looks up page refs
Uses: mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer(left_click, ref="ref_27")
Result: Always clicks the correct button using stable ref
```

### Using Element Refs

The metadata file contains element refs for:
- **Navigation**: Sidebar menu items, workspace cards
- **Actions**: Add/Edit/Delete buttons
- **Forms**: All form fields with types and validation
- **Dialogs**: Tab switches, submit/cancel buttons

Example usage pattern:
```javascript
// Navigate to HTTP Load Balancers
click(ref="ref_7")  // Load Balancers menu item

// Click Add button
click(ref="ref_27") // Add HTTP Load Balancer

// Fill form fields
type(ref="ref_150", "my-load-balancer")  // Name field
type(ref="ref_181", "example.com")       // Domain field
click(ref="ref_423")                      // Submit button
```

### Fallback Strategy

If a ref doesn't work (UI changed), Claude falls back to:
1. Use `find()` with descriptive text
2. Report the mismatch for metadata update
3. Continue with the task

### Crawl Command

To refresh the metadata:
```
/xc:console crawl https://nferreira.staging.volterra.us/
```

See `crawl-workflow.md` for the detailed crawl process.

## Current Status

**Phase 2 Progress**:
- ✅ Skill directory structure created
- ✅ SKILL.md written with comprehensive instructions
- ✅ Azure SSO login tested and working
- ✅ Console crawl scripts created (`scripts/crawl-console.js`)
- ✅ Crawl workflow documented (`crawl-workflow.md`)
- ✅ HTTP Load Balancer form fully extracted with 60+ element refs
- ✅ Deterministic navigation metadata v2.0.0 saved
- 🔄 Extracting remaining resource forms

## Next Steps

1. **Crawl Remaining Workspaces**
   - Origin Pools form extraction
   - WAF Policies form extraction
   - DNS Load Balancers form extraction

2. **Automate Periodic Crawl**
   - Schedule weekly crawl to catch UI changes
   - Alert on significant metadata changes

3. **Validate with CLI**
   ```bash
   f5xcctl configuration list http_loadbalancer --all-namespaces
   ```
